## Day_8 Caesar Cipher Project

The algotithm of Caeser Cipher holds the followint features:-

- Caesar Cipher Technique is the simple and easy method of encryption technique.
- It is simple type of substitution cipher.
- Each letter of plain text is replaced by a letter with some fixed number of positions down with alphabet.

The following diagram depicts the working of Caesar cipher algorithm implementation âˆ’

Explanation

</div>

The plain text character is traversed one at a time.

- For each character in the given plain text, transform the given character as per the rule depending on the procedure of encryption and decryption of text.
- After the steps is followed, a new string is generated which is referred as cipher text.

## Day_9 Blind Auction Project
<p align="Justify">
You log into the program and give your name and your bid. Once you are done with your bid, the program asks you if there are any other bidders. If you type "yes", then the screen clears and you hand over the laptop to the next person who is going to make their bid. Till it gets to the turn of the final bidder. when everyone is done bidding and the prgram asks "If there is any other bidder?", you type "no". Then the program will tally up all the bids and figure out who bid the highest, and give a winner, printing out the name of the winner, and their bid.

## Day_10 Build a Calculator Project
<p aligh="Justify">
This is a text based calculator. You start by writing a numberv  and then picking one of the operations; Plus (+), Minus (-), Multiply (*) Divide (/). Then it shows you the full calculaton. And now you can continue calculating with the answer from the previous steps. Or you can type "n" to start a new calculation.

## Day_11 Black Jack Project
<p align="Justify">
The game is pretty simple, you request the dealer to give you two cards. You are trying to get as close to 21 as possible, but not over 21, and all of the cards which have a Jack, a Queen, or a King, count as 10. So you add the numbers on the cards. And you are trying to figure out if you can risk another card. If the total sum of numbers on your cards is less than 21 and less than the sum of the dealers you win, else the dealer wins.
</p>

## Day_12 Number Guessing Project
<p align="Justify">
   The program tells you that it is thinking of a number between 1 and 100. It then asks you to        choose a difficulty between "Hard" or "Easy". Now it tells you that you have 5 attempts to guess    the number, and you make a guess, if you guess a number greater than the chosen number, the        program tells you, that the number is too high and it's not the  number that it was thinking,      and your number of attempts decreases by one. Then it asks you to make a guess again. An if you    guess a number less that the chosen number, the program tells you that the number is too low,      decrease you number of attempts by one and asks you to guess again. You keep guessing till you      get the right number, or till you run out of attempts and you loose the game.

## Day_14 Higer or Lower
<p align="Justify">
This game is comparing who had more followers on Instagram. You will compare two celebrities and guess which of them has more followers. If you guess wrong the game ends, but if you get it right, you score a point. And this game continues on and on until you get to the point where you get it wrong. The aim of the game is to try and stay alive for as long as possible and score as high as possible by thinking about who might be more popular than the other.

<p align="Justify">
This coffee machine will have the ability to:
 
**1. Make 3 hot flavours**
 * Expresso

<img src="/img/starting_resources.png">

**2. Coin Operated**
* Penny (1 cent)
* Nickel (5 cent)
* Dime (10 cent)
* Quarter (25 cent)

**Program Requirements**
1. Print report
2. Check resources sufficient?
3. Process coins

The program is able to look through all the resources that the machine has, checks it againstthe recipe of the drin that we are trying to make, and tells the user if there is insufficient water, or if there is insufficient milk, and as long as one of the resources is insufficient, then it cant make the drink and it gives the feedback to the user. 

Also, the program needs to process coins. When the user orders for a drink, it should ask the user to insert coins and also ask for the quantity of each type of coin. If there is not enough money for the requested drink, the program refunds your money and does not give you a drink. But if you do insert enough money, the program calculates the amount of change based on the cost of the requested drink, and hands you your drink and your change.
